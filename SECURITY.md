# Security Policy

It is the poolicy of this project to create "secure by default"
software, althoug as has too often been proven, that isn't always
practical. We appreciate any security reports, ideally as described
in the "reporting a vulnerability" section below.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |

At present the project has not created any official releases, so 
when reporting a security issue, plese use the commit ID and any
other relevant information ehen reporting vulnerabilities at this
time.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email terri-decus@glaver.org with as detailed a report
as possible, including specific commits where possible. That
mailbox is ony accessible by the project leader (me) and is
hosted on a system that noone else has access to.

I will endeavor to respond to all reports within 24 hours,
although if I'm traveling the timeframe may stretch out for
a few days.

My initial response will generally be one of the following:
1) Confirmed bug - fix anticipated with X days
2) Additional information needed to characterize this as a bug
3) Issue is with an upstream or 3rd-party feature
4) Unable to reproduce the problem; more information needed
5) Not a bug because <explanation>

Once things have proceeded to confirmed bug status, I expect
to publish a fix within 30 days of receiing a confirmed bug,
and ofen much sooner than that.

As the project does not current cut "releases", corrections
will appear in the main reposititory (with things like PoC
examples removed).

If at any time you feel I am not being responsive enough to
your vulnerability report, please re-send it with a Subject
line beginning with "ESCALATION:"
